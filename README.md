# Physics-Based-Dynamic Fuel Moisture content (FMC)
This repository hosts the code related to the paper "A Physics-Based Model of Dynamically Varying Fuel Moisture Content in Response to Microclimatic Effects for Fire Behavior Prediction" authored by Ritambhara Raj Dubey and Neda Yaghoobian. The purpose of this repository is to provide access to the code implementation described in the paper. The repository is maintained by the authors of this paper.

# Usage- Dynamic FMC model
1. Download fortran Dynamic_FMC_model.f90 and the input files (.csv) from Github.
2. Open fortran using Fortran IDE (such as CodeBlock) on your computer.
3. Run the file xx.f90
4. Check the result files in the same directory as the code.
5. Run the Matlab file to plot the resultls of fuel moisture content using the dynamic FMC model
